"""Slope / tilt bands from the IMU attitude (pure Python, no ROS; tilt_monitor wraps it).

2026-10-09. Why a host-side guard although the MCU already has one: the cutter firmware
(0.6.36, docs/mcu_protocol_spec.md 10c) asserts ``lift`` only when the forwarded IMU leaves
pitch [-36.8, +40.1] deg or |roll| > 38.5 deg, i.e. when the mower is already about to roll
or flip, and it LATCHES after ~17 s (clear-estop then works only while the IMU reads level).
Before that point nothing slowed the mower down or kept it off a slope it cannot hold.

Input: roll / pitch of the WIT JY61P orientation. The JY61P fuses accelerometer + gyro
itself; its roll / pitch are gravity referenced (only its yaw is gyro-integrated and not
earth referenced, which this module never uses). REP-103 signs: +roll = left side up,
+pitch = nose DOWN.

Mounting: on this Tron the forwarded attitude reads ~0 / ~0 upright (verified 2026-10-06:
the clear frame released a latched lift with the IMU forwarded unmodified). The vendor
capture showed roll ~ -178 deg (WIT mounted upside down relative to the vendor frame);
``mount_roll_offset_deg`` / ``mount_pitch_offset_deg`` exist for such a board and are
applied as a rotation of the gravity vector (a 180 deg roll offset is exact, not an angle
subtraction that breaks near +-180). Without the right offset an inverted board reads
~180 deg = CRITICAL: the guard fails safe and the node logs the hint.

Bands (separate thresholds per axis; roll = side slope / rollover risk, pitch = up/down):

=========  =====================================================================
ok         nothing
caution    slow down (mission caps the controller speed), blade stays on
limit      stop forward motion, blade off, back out along the driven track, mark
           the cells 'steep' in the terrain memory (mission)
critical   immediate stop on /cmd_vel_emergency + cutter off (tilt_monitor itself,
           independent of the mission) and a mission EMERGENCY
=========  =====================================================================

Filtering, so that roots / kerbs do not trigger:

* first-order low-pass (``filter_tau_s``) on the body-frame gravity vector (roll and
  pitch are read from the filtered vector);
* a band is ENTERED only after its condition (|roll| >= roll threshold OR |pitch| >= pitch
  threshold, on the filtered values) held continuously for that band's debounce
  (caution 1.0 s, limit 0.6 s, critical 0.3 s by default). A higher band can be entered
  directly from any lower one; its own debounce counts from when its condition began;
* a band is LEFT only after both axes stayed below (threshold - ``hysteresis_deg``) for
  ``clear_s``; the band then drops to the highest band whose hysteresis-reduced condition
  still holds (no second debounce on the way down);
* no IMU sample for ``stale_s`` -> band 'unknown' (consumers keep their last decision and
  do not act on it; the node reports it).
